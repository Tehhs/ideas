# Ideas 

Here are just a list of some ideas that I want to work on in the future. 

* Doom style game, no engine, Clang or my own programming language once complete.
* Spotify join friends listening session
* GPT from the ground up
* Brimstone Lineup bruteforcer
* Chrome extension to hide youtube videos
* DLL that tampers with all call instructions in a program and re-routes the calls to a sub-routine
* JS inside CSS file
* My own frontend JS framework
* CSS Sucks - make a new styling language and use javascript to do everything inside a canvas, who cares about performance.
* Electronic chessboard with arduino
* Analyze twitch dbd videos and spit out player statistics
* OCR nutrition information and feed it into GPT model to find key product information (calories, protein, sugars, ect)
* Dreambooth version of GPT that is designed for fine-tuning on a codebase / repo.
* Kernal level cheat driver 
* Sleep analysis android app
* (In-Progress) GPT-powered 3d room generator
* Tool to easily train a gpt model on a github repo / codebase; maybe tool to auto-document functions once GPT understands the codebase
* Chrome extension when you highllight a word, it highlights all matches on the same page (basically CTRL+C, CTRL+F, CTRL+V shortcut)
