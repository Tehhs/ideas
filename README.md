# Ideas 

Here are just a list of some ideas that I want to work on in the future. 

* Doom style game, no engine, Clang or my own programming language once complete.
* Spotify join friends listening session
* GPT from the ground up
* Brimstone Lineup bruteforcer
* Chrome Extension to Hide youtube videos
* DLL that tampers with all call instructions in a program and re-routes the calls to a sub-routine
