# Ideas 

Here are just a list of some ideas that I want to work on in the future. 

# Ideas I still care about 

* Update cors unblocker to recent chrome version
* DLL that tampers with all call instructions in a program and re-routes the calls to a sub-routine. Had this working a while ago with bugs.
* Kernal level cheat driver 
* explore wave function collapse
* webgl shaders, examples at https://webgl-shaders.com/
* Bezier curves https://www.jasondavies.com/animated-bezier/
* revamp website, include blogging/articles from cdn
* Hold down on a word to replace it with a simpiler word
* OpenTK (OpenGL) C# Minecraft remake + game engine 
* Your own encryption, even if it's dogshi*
* I really want to explore remote execution via buffer overlows. For fun, maybe explore potential exploits in torrent software.
  * https://github.com/gh0x0st/Buffer_Overflow
  * https://steflan-security.com/tryhackme-buffer-overflow-prep/
* Re-write shelby in GO
* Babel JS=>ASX, ASX=>Brainfuck+. Brainfuck+ to make brainfuck less annoying, do something like 15> to do > 15 times, Can do for + and - too.
* Some babel black magic so you can make reference to .cs C# classes to do things like type checks against a model

* redact.local
* Erlang / BEAM is f***ing amazing.

# Ideas I dont care about anymore 
* ~~Electronic chessboard with arduino~~
* ~~Chrome extension when you highllight a word, it highlights all matches on the same page (basically CTRL+C, CTRL+F, CTRL+V shortcut)~~
* ~~OCR nutrition information and feed it into GPT model to find key product information (calories, protein, sugars, ect)~~
* ~~JS inside CSS file~~
* ~~My own frontend JS framework~~
* ~~CSS Sucks - make a new styling language and use javascript to do everything inside a canvas, who cares about performance.~~
* ~~Doom style game, no engine, Clang or my own programming language once complete.~~
* ~~Spotify join friends listening session~~
* ~~GPT from the ground up~~
* ~~Analyze twitch dbd videos and spit out player statistics~~
* ~~Sheer any animal in minecraft~~
* ~~General task/timer lib. Every("Friday").Fire(func); Every("Friday").At("3PM").Fire(func); Every("Month").Fire(func); https://gist.github.com/Tehhs/31b35457ab20993e97a6db5163a90c75~~
* ~~Easy english functions in code powered by GPT~~
* ~~Custom WIndows 11 search because HOLY * windows 11 search is BAD and annoying~~
* ~~Chrome extension that will just look for any timezone strings in the body and just convert them to local so you dont see shit like "14:00 GMT" some some shit like that~~
* ~~Probably done a million times by a million other people but - do a 3D Atom/Electron/Particle simulator that simulates interactions between different elements/atoms/ions/anions. Maybe make the simulator VERY VERY quick and efficient so you can incorperate it into a game at some point. Maybe incorperate some type of thermal-dynamics into it (heating causes state changes solid=>liquid=>gas). And if you somehow do all that you can simulate the electomagnetic waves to simulate wireless communications.~~
* ~~Process tracker / game tracker / activity tracker~~
* ~~drawing pad to aiming device~~
* ~~http as many requests as possible~~
* ~~Youtube-music sync to spotify sessions~~
* ~~emulate a calculator processor or something~~
* ~~discord bot to handle timezone conversions because its getting annoying~~
* ~~integrate OpenAI's Chatgpt into your discord bot so it can help users work out how to use the bot~~
* ~~check db/sound level of yt video before playing it so it doesn't burst my ear drums~~
* ~~dbd video analyze~~
* ~~With kernal access, there must be some way to hook to some internal windows function to constantly monitor EIP/RIP without attaching to a process via debugging (as that doesnt work very well). Do this to somehow work out which functions are being called in a process at any particular time. (Edit: Probably not possible)~~
* ~~Single CPP file with deploys any method I know on preventing hacks/cheats from attaching to the process.~~
* ~~Sleep analysis android app~~
* ~~(In-Progress) GPT-powered 3d room generator~~
* ~~Tool to easily train a gpt model on a github repo / codebase; maybe tool to auto-document functions once GPT understands the codebase~~
* ~~Dreambooth version of GPT that is designed for fine-tuning on a codebase / repo.~~
