# Ideas 

Here are just a list of some ideas that I want to work on in the future. 

* Doom style game, no engine, Clang or my own programming language once complete.
* Spotify join friends listening session
* GPT from the ground up
* DLL that tampers with all call instructions in a program and re-routes the calls to a sub-routine
* JS inside CSS file
* My own frontend JS framework
* CSS Sucks - make a new styling language and use javascript to do everything inside a canvas, who cares about performance.
* Electronic chessboard with arduino
* Analyze twitch dbd videos and spit out player statistics
* OCR nutrition information and feed it into GPT model to find key product information (calories, protein, sugars, ect)
* Dreambooth version of GPT that is designed for fine-tuning on a codebase / repo.
* Kernal level cheat driver 
* Sleep analysis android app
* (In-Progress) GPT-powered 3d room generator
* Tool to easily train a gpt model on a github repo / codebase; maybe tool to auto-document functions once GPT understands the codebase
* Chrome extension when you highllight a word, it highlights all matches on the same page (basically CTRL+C, CTRL+F, CTRL+V shortcut)
* With kernal access, there must be some way to hook to some internal windows function to constantly monitor EIP/RIP without attaching to a process via debugging (as that doesnt work very well). Do this to somehow work out which functions are being called in a process at any particular time. (Edit: Probably not possible)
* Single CPP file with deploys any method I know on preventing hacks/cheats from attaching to the process.
* explore wave function collapse
* discord bot to handle timezone conversions because its getting annoying
* integrate OpenAI's Chatgpt into your discord bot so it can help users work out how to use the bot
* check db/sound level of yt video before playing it so it doesn't burst my ear drums
* dbd video analyze
* webgl shaders, examples at https://webgl-shaders.com/
* emulate a calculator processor or something
* Bezier curves https://www.jasondavies.com/animated-bezier/
* drawing pad to aiming device
* http as many requests as possible
* Youtube-music sync to spotify sessions
* revamp website
* Process tracker / game tracker / activity tracker
* Hold down on a word to replace it with a simpiler word
* OpenTK (OpenGL) C# Minecraft
* Sheer any animal in minecraft
* General task/timer lib. Every("Friday").Fire(func); Every("Friday").At("3PM").Fire(func); Every("Month").Fire(func); https://gist.github.com/Tehhs/31b35457ab20993e97a6db5163a90c75
* Easy english functions in code powered by GPT
function findWords(inputString) : int[] {
  all words in inputString that contain "the" and output the amount
}
* Custom WIndows 11 search because HOLY * windows 11 search is BAD and annoying
* Chrome extension that will just look for any timezone strings in the body and just convert them to local so you dont see shit like "14:00 GMT" some some shit like that 
* Probably done a million times by a million other people but - do a 3D Atom/Electron/Particle simulator that simulates interactions between different elements/atoms/ions/anions. Maybe make the simulator VERY VERY quick and efficient so you can incorperate it into a game at some point. Maybe incorperate some type of thermal-dynamics into it (heating causes state changes solid=>liquid=>gas). And if you somehow do all that you can simulate the electomagnetic waves to simulate wireless communications.
